# DAY 2 — NODE CLI APP + CONCURRENCY + LARGE DATA PROCESSING

## Learning Outcomes
- Built a Node.js CLI tool
- Processed large text files asynchronously
- Measured performance across different concurrency levels

## Summary
A CLI application was created to analyze a large text corpus and generate word statistics.  
Concurrency was implemented using Promise-based chunk processing and benchmarked for performance.

## Deliverables
- `wordstat.js` — CLI tool  
- `output/stats.json` — Final results  
- `logs/perf-summary.json` — Performance benchmarks
